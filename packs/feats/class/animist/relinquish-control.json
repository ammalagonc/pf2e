Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +4 status bonus on saves against spells and effects that give you the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Controlled] condition or attempt to influence your actions (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Charm], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Command], or a nosoi's haunting melody). However, the only actions you can take are to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Recall Knowledge], Step, Strike, Cast an apparition Spell, Cast a vessel Spell, Sustain a vessel spell, or use an action that has the apparition trait. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Recall Knowledge checks made using Lore skills granted by your attuned apparitions.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> This feat requires a particularly strong bond with a specific apparition to learn. Choose one apparition you have access to; once you learn this feat, you must always choose that apparition as one of the apparitions you attune to each day.</p>"
