Attempt a @Check[medicine|dc:40] check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of raise dead, except it still has the wounded condition it had before dying, increased by 1 (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Wounded]{Wounded 1} if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Desperate Resuscitation for 1 day.</p>"
