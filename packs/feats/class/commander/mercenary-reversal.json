The target attempts a @Check[will|against:class] save against your class DC with the following results.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is uninterested in joining you and is temporarily immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned]{Stunned 1} as it is forced to consider the merits of your offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target swaps sides and joins you for the duration of the battle. It gains the controlled condition, but it can attempt a Will save whenever it takes damage or whenever you direct it to take an action that goes against its nature. On a success, the effect ends and it rejoins its former allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As a failure, but the target is so impressed by your leadership that it thanks you for the privilege of fighting alongside you; if it is still alive at the end of combat, it turns over any coins, wealth or other monetary possessions it has as tribute.</p>"
