You must end this movement adjacent to an ally who is within an enemy's reach. Then, you push your ally up to 5 feet (as normal for forced movement, this movement doesn't trigger reactions) and make a melee Strike against an enemy within your reach. If your ally was in that enemy's reach and your push moved them out of it, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll.</p>"
