You can push any enemy that fails its save 5 feet away from you (or up to 10 feet on a critical failure). The damage increases by 1d6 per level beyond 14th.</p>\n<p>Your armor gains the broken condition. While your armor remains broken due to Armor Break, you don't take its penalty to Speed. In addition, if the broken armor has the bulwark trait, you retain its bonus to Reflex saves, but the bonus is reduced by 1.</p>"
