Your stomp's counteract rank equals half your level (rounded up), and for the roll, use either your class DC â€“ 10 or your spellcasting attribute modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus. If you successfully counteract the triggering effect, you suppress the effect for 1 minute, after which the effect returns if its duration hasn't expired.</p>"
