Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain resistance 5 to physical damage. At 10th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the resistance increases by 5. Any blows that strike you during this time make no sound as their energy is drained.</p>\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> You can extend your dampening field around you to create a safe haven for your allies. If you spend an additional action when using Kinetic Dampening, your field extends in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15] around you. You can choose which creatures within the emanation are affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Awakening</strong> You dampen a greater variety of wavelengths. When you use this feat, you also gain resistance to your choice of fire, electricity, or sonic damage.</p>"
