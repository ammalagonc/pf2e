Choose a creature wielding a melee or ranged weapon within your reach and attempt a Thievery check against their Reflex DC. On a success, the weapon's wielder must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:11] the next time it attempts a Strike with that weapon or the action is disrupted, as part of the weapon's structural integrity falters. The creature is then temporarily immune to Battlefront Sabotage of their weapons for 10 minutes.</p>"
