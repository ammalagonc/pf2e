When you use Deception to Lie, you can carefully structure your deceits so that each individual statement you make is the truth, from a certain perspective. Once per day when using Deception to Lie, you can roll twice and take the better result. This is a fortune effect.</p>\n<p>You don't take a penalty to Deception checks while subject to the ring of truth spell or similar effects. Whenever you are subject to ring of truth or a similar effect, you can attempt a Deception check when you first begin speaking to counteract the spell's effects, with a counteract rank equal to half your level (rounded up); succeeding at this check doesn't end the spell or effect, but it does cause it to indicate that you are speaking the truth, even when you are actually lying.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: The Truth As I See It]</p>"
