Each creature whose space it moves through is subjected to the horde's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Mobbing Assault], attempting a basic Reflex save as usual. A creature who fails the saving throw is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Reposition]{Repositioned} to an unoccupied square of your choice adjacent to the horde's final position.
