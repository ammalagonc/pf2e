When any effect attempts to anchor you to a plane (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Planar Tether]) or to banish you from the current plane (such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Banishment]), that effect gains the incapacitation trait. If it already has the incapacitation trait, you gain a +4 status bonus to your save against the effect. If you successfully save against such an effect, the creature that attempted to use this effect on you must succeed at a @Check[will|against:class-spell] save against your class or spell DC (whichever is higher) to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 1} for 1 minute (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stupefied]{Stupefied 2} on a critical failure).</p>\n<p>You also lay claim to one of the following domains of your choice: dreams, fate, or travel.</p>"
