Where originally these disadvantages may have been myths themselves, or simply manifestations of ill fortune or chance, when you take this feat, one of those weaknesses becomes real.</p>\n<p>Work with your GM to choose your heroic weaknessâ€”it must be to a specific damage type and must be associated with a specific condition, both of which must be elements that are going to be significant parts of your story's future. For example, you could choose for a weakness to be spirit damage caused to you by a follower of a rival god, physical damage from a specific category of weapon, void damage caused by a specific kind of undead, or fire damage taken in a certain part of the world or from creatures from that part of the world. The amount of weakness you gain to this damage is equal to twice your level.</p>\n<p>But with this new weakness comes a new source of power, for when your foes would take advantage of your weakness, you can use the pain and humiliation to bolster your own resolve. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Makes Me Stronger] reaction.</p>"
