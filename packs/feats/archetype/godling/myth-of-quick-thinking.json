You can Lie as a two-action activity, regardless of how elaborate your tale. When you attempt a Deception check, you can spend a Mythic Point to do so at mythic proficiency. If you succeed at a Deception check while in the presence of your hierophant, any of your worshippers that you can see automatically succeed at an attempt to Impersonate or Lie in such a way that supports your story (for example, the target of your Lie claiming you are a teacher sees all of your worshippers as students).</p>\n<p>You also lay claim to one of the following domains of your choice: confidence, secrecy, or trickery.</p>"
