You can choose for an adjacent ally to gain the benefits of the <em>shield</em> spell instead of yourself. If the ally would take damage from a physical attack while protected by your <em>shield</em> cantrip, you can use your reaction to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Shield Block] with the spell on their behalf.</p>"
