You use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Battle Medicine] on one ally affected by the required spell. You do not need to be holding or wearing a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Healer's Toolkit], as you conjure glowing threads, bandages, or similar supplies out of pure magic, which adds the arcane trait to Battle Medicine.</p>"
