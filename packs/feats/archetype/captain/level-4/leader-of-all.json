For example, elf followers have the elf and humanoid traits, a 30-foot speed, low-light vision, and the typical languages for elves. Followers don't use their ancestry's Hit Points or attribute boosts and flaws. They also don't gain abilities that would allow them to use actions beyond the standard ones available to a follower, such as Activating an Item or Casting a Spell.</p>"
