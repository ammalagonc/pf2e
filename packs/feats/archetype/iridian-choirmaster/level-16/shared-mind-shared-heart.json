You develop a permanent mental connection, allowing you to communicate telepathically as long as you're on the same plane. When one of you fails a save against a mental effect, the other can choose to take the results of the failed save instead. If both of you are targeted by the same mental effect requiring a saving throw, you and your student take the better of each of your die rolls for the save. You each still add your own save modifier to the die result. This is a fortune effect.</p>"
