The last wagon in the caravan contains a boiler and scullery services for cleaning kitchen utensils and dishes. On the roof of each wagon is an herb garden to ensure a fresh supply for all meals, and mounted beneath all wagons are water and beer storage. Each cook's caravan carries enough supplies to feed its crew, passengers, 12 Large creatures, and 500 soldiers for a month before needing to be restocked.</p>",
