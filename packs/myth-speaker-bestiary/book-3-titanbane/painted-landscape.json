Such gear can't be disarmed. If the painted creature drops any gear, the item melts into a glob of paint a moment later—after dealing damage, for thrown and projectile weapons. Painted gear (including ammunition) is restored to a painted creature automatically 24 hours after it's lost. At the GM's discretion, a talented PC artist might rescue a painted item by immediately and successfully Repairing it, using a hard DC of the painted creature's level. This might allow PCs to recover a unique (even magical) item that existed only in the original artist's imagination.</p><h2>Painted Behavior</h2><p>Painted creatures typically adopt the behaviors of whatever they resemble. This results in creatures like a painted sheep bleating worriedly and grazing, even though any grasses consumed sit inertly inside its improvised belly before eventually seeping though its body and plopping on the ground.</p>\n<p>Intelligent creatures animated in this way sometimes develop a limited vocabulary. However, the construct remains mindless, their utterances follow only the most simplistic logic, and their words fall short of anything that could be considered conversation. With careful instruction, such constructs can perform mundane chores.</p>",
