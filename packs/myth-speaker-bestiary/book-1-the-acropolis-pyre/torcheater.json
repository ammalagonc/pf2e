They're also a threat to travelers, especially those traversing the roads after dark. An encounter with a torcheater on a dark and winding road through the mountains can be deadly if they snuff the traveler's light. However, torcheaters can't stand being the subject of pranks in turn. If caught or taunted, a torcheater can quickly turn violent and attack their tormentor.</p>\n<p>In rare places of near-constant light where shadows don't fall, a torcheater can still exist in a sort of limbo where they're aware of their surroundings but unable manifest enough to affect the world around them. They can only hope for some shade to fall across them so they can then begin to restore their shadowy forms.</p><h2>Shadowy Witnesses</h2><p>A torcheater's first glimpse of the world is whatever crime created it. Most of these spirits treat the event as inspiration, teaching them that tormenting others is acceptable. However, a placated torcheater might provide unique testimony about what they witnessed, helping investigators track down an otherwise unstoppable criminal.</p>",
