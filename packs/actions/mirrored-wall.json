The formation bounces light off the raised shield and into the enemy's eyes; the target must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|against:commander|options:inflicts:blinded,inflicts:dazzled] saving throw against your class DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Blinded] for 1 round (on a critical failure, the creature remains @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] for 3 rounds after the blindness ends).</p>\n<p>You can signal additional allies with raised shields to participate in this tactic; the target takes a circumstance penalty on this save equal to the number of additional participating squadmates (to a maximum â€“4 circumstance penalty to the target's save).</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Effect: Mirrored Wall]</p>"
