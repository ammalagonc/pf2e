Locks of higher quality might require multiple successes to unlock. If you lack the proper tools, the GM might let you use improvised picks, which are treated as a shoddy toolkit.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You unlock the lock, or you achieve two successes toward opening a lock that requires more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You open the lock, or you achieve one success toward opening a lock that requires more than one success. You leave behind damage that indicates the lock was picked on close scrutiny.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You break your toolkit and leave behind obvious damage. Fixing a broken toolkit requires using Crafting to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Repair] it or else swapping in @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Thieves' Toolkit (Replacement Picks)]{replacement picks} (costing 3 sp, or 3 gp for an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator)]{infiltrator thieves' toolkit}).</p>"
