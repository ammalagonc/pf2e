Apply your own immunities, weaknesses, and resistances to the damage, not the ally's.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong> You can extend this ability to an ally within 15 feet of you if the damage comes from your taunted enemy. If this ally is farther than you can Step to reach, you can Stride instead of Stepping; you still must end the movement adjacent to your ally.</p>"
