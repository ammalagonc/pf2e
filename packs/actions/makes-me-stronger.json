Your spells gain a status bonus to damage against the triggering creature equal to twice their rank; this lasts until the next time you use this reaction. In addition, the creature that damaged you with your heroic weakness must attempt a Will save against your class or spellcasting DC, whichever is higher, to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 1} (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2} on a critical failure).</p>"
