Other creatures can't occupy its space, but allies can pass through its space. When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain it, you can have the tree make a branches Strike against a creature within 15 feet of it, dealing 2d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time.</p>\n<p>If the tree is in soil and survives to the end of the spell's duration, it remains as an ordinary, non-magical tree and continues to grow and thrive. The GM might determine that the tree disappears immediately in certain inhospitable situations.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The animated tree has 10 additional Hit Points, and its branches Strike deals 1d8 additional damage.</p>"
