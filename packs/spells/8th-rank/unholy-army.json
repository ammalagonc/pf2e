The army's space and every square in a 20-foot emanation is choked with burning ash and smog, making all creatures outside the smoke @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Concealed] to creatures within it and all creatures within the smoke concealed to creatures outside the smoke and other creatures within it. This smoke lasts for 1 minute, and a creature who enters or begins its turn within the smoke must attempt a Fortitude save or take 2d6 persistent fire damage and become sickened 1 (3d6 persistent fire damage and sickened 2 on a critical failure)</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> (fire) <em>Swords of Flame</em> The arson demons swing their flaming swords through your enemies' ranks.

On a critical failure they take a –20-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds and 4d6 persistent bleed damage. This penalty to Speeds lasts until they recover from their persistent bleed damage</li><li><strong>Depart</strong> <em>Pleasant Screams</em> The sacristans rip their chains from their victims, screaming in unison with their pain. Any enemies who failed the initial Reflex save during the sacristans' arrival take 4d8 piercing damage (basic Fortitude save). In addition, everyone in a 60-foot cone must attempt a Will save. On a failure, they're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 2} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Deafened] for 1 minute (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened]{Frightened 3} and deafened for 1 minute on a critical failure); this effect has the auditory, emotion, fear, and mental traits.</li></ul></li></ul>"
