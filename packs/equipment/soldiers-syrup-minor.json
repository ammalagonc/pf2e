            "value": "<p>This thick syrup sweetens potions and creates a distinctive, metallic flavor associated with the festival days in Dhuraxilis. Partygoers are fond of mixing <em>soldier's syrup</em> with potions to extend their release.</p>\n<p>Activating a dose of <em>soldier's syrup</em> requires you to combine it with another consumable potion that takes 1 action to activate. After swirling the mixture for a few moments, you must either imbibe the augmented potion within 1 minute, or the potion reverts to its unaugmented state. The potion's level cannot exceed that of the <em>soldier's syrup</em> it is mixed with, otherwise the syrup is wasted.</p>\n<p>When consumed, a <em>soldier's syrup</em>–augmented potion does not immediately grant its benefits to you. Instead, you can activate the potion within the next hour as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You can have only one <em>soldier's syrup</em>–augmented potion consumed at a time; consuming a second one renders the first one inert. If you do not activate the potion within 1 hour, the potion spoils inside you, and you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Enfeebled]{Enfeebled 1} for 24 hours.</p>"
