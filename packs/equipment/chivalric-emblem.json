A <em>chivalric emblem</em> is crafted in the form of a small iron shield, embossed with heraldic insignia. These whetstones call protective spirits into a weapon; the effects last for 1 hour. While wielding a weapon under the effect of a <em>chivalric emblem</em>, if you witness an ally being reduced to 0 Hit Points or taking damage from a critical Strike, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and damage with that weapon against the creature that damaged that ally for the remainder of the <em>chivalric emblem</em>'s duration.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Chivalric Emblem]</p>"
