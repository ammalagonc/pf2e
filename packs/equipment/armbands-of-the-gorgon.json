When you invest the armbands, you either increase your Constitution modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You clap the bracers together and remove a single condition of your choice currently afflicting you.
