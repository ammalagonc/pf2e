The ring doesn't change your appearance beyond concealing weapons and armor. As soon as you wield a weapon affected by the ring, the weapon becomes obvious to onlookers and is no longer affected until you sheathe the weapon for at least 1 minute. A creature can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Seek] action to examine you and disbelieve this illusion ([[/act seek dc=15]]{DC 15}), and it can attempt to do so without using an action each time it hits you with an attack.</p>"
