These blinders, made of dark brown leather, nearly cover an animal's eyes and prevent it from seeing the dangers around them.</p>\n<p>It takes 1 minute to affix the blinders on an animal, whose attitude toward you must be indifferent or better. These blinders can be used only on a domesticated animal that doesn't have combat training or the minion trait. Animals with these blinders on do not suffer from the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Frightened] condition due to being in combat, nor do they automatically flee combat, as would be normal for an animal without combat training. Unless mounted by a rider with the paired headband, which is braided from the same dark brown leather, the animal's speed is reduced to 10 feet.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activateâ€”It Can't Hurt You</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> An animal within 30 feet wearing the paired blinders attempts a saving throw against a fear effect but hasn't rolled yet</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You grant a +1 status bonus to its saving throw against the triggering effect.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: It Can't Hurt You]</p>"
