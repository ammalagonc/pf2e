You make any decisions for a spell cast by the top unless otherwise indicated, except that it must target the creature you chose, or the creature you chose must be the center of the spell's area, if it has an area but no targets. If the spell's range is less than 60 feet, increase the range to 60 feet.</p>\n<p>Any spell DC required is DC 27, and any spell attack roll required is +17. If the top casts a spell on you, you don't get a saving throw or other defense against it.</p>\n<p>The top can't be activated again for [[/br 1d4 #hours]]{1d4 hours}.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.rollable-tables.RollTable.Madcap Top Effect]</p>"
