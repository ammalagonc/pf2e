With a little soil and patience, it can quickly grow into a sheltering tree that later bestows the user with a new <em>gift of olives</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Sew the Cutting</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (healing, manipulate, plant)</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are outside and standing atop an unoccupied 5-foot square with some soil</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You drive one end of the cutting into the soil. The cutting immediately grows into an olive tree whose boughs shelter a 15-foot-diameter area. Creatures in the sheltered area gain resistance 3 to any environmental damage, gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against environmental hazards, and gain a +1 status bonus to Survival checks to Subsist. After 10 minutes, the tree sprouts 8 olives, each of which can be eaten as an action to restore 1 Hit Point and nourish the eater as if they had consumed a full meal. After 8 hours, the olives lose their potency, and the <em>gift of olives</em> cutting detaches from the tree and falls harmlessly to the ground. The olive tree loses its protective abilities and becomes a normal, non-magical olive tree that survives so long as it's growing in a suitable location.</p>"
