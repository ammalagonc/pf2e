            "value": "<p>While most residents of—and travelers to—the Five Kings Mountains live underground, a significant number of people explore the regions' awe-inspiring peaks. Among their many discoveries on Emperor's Peak is a deposit of rainbow-colored rock crystal quartz with inherent magical properties that aid in survival, especially in the mountains. Dwarven artisans fashion chunks of this translucent quartz into fashionable bracelets.</p>\n<p>Wearing such a bracelet grants you a +1 item bonus to Survival checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Direction] and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Subsist]. This bonus increases to +3 when in mountainous terrain. If you attempt a Survival check to Subsist after 8 hours or less of exploration, you take only a –2 penalty instead of a –5 penalty.</p>"
