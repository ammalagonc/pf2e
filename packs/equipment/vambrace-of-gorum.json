            "value": "<p>When the Lord in Iron shattered, immeasurable fragments fell to Golarion as pieces of metal. This piece of his armor has been shaped into the Vambrace of Gorum, a supreme reinforcing high-grade adamantine shield (Hardness 20, HP 160, BT 80). Pieces of sharp iron stick out, acting as +3 major striking shield spikes. The Vambrace still holds some of the deity's power. When the shield is broken, small fragments of metal explode outward, dealing @Damage[6d6[piercing]|options:area-damage] damage in a @Template[type:cone|distance:15] (@Check[reflex|dc:40|basic] save).</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Blade of Iron</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, divine, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The shield reforms into a +3 high-grade adamantine major striking greatsword for 1 minute. While wielding this sword, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC for each adjacent enemy (up to a +4 bonus).</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Blood of Iron</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (aura, divine)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The Vambrace of Gorum is in its shield form</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Your shield becomes an empowering symbol of the thrill of battle. You and your allies within 10 feet of you gain 30 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour, and reduce your clumsy, enfeebled, frightened, and stupefied conditions by 1.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Bones of Iron</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You use the shield to Shield Block and the attack overcomes the shield's Hardness</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The iron spikes lash out at the creature who made the attack.
