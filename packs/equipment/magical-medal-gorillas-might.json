No matter how many magical medals you have, they collectively count as one invested item.</p>\n<p>This steel medal resembles the head and upper body of a gorilla. It's typically given in recognition of physical prowess, and it grants you a +1 item bonus to Athletics checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Climb], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Force Open], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.High Jump], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Long Jump].</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Gorilla's Second Leap</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate, fortune)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You would fail but not critically fail an Athletics check to High Jump or Long Jump</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The gorilla on the medal beats its chest, giving you another chance.
