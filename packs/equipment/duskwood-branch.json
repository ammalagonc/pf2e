A duskwood item's Bulk is reduced by 1 (or to light Bulk if its normal Bulk is 1, with no effect on an item that normally has light Bulk). The Price of an item made of duskwood is based on the item's normal Bulk, not its reduced Bulk for being made of duskwood, but reduce the Bulk before making any further Bulk adjustments for the size of the item.</p><h2>Duskwood Items</h2><table class=\"pf2e remaster\"><thead><tr><th>Duskwood Items</th><th>Hardness</th><th>HP</th><th>BT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Thin Items</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard-grade</td><td>5</td><td>20</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>High-grade</td><td>8</td><td>32</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Items</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard-grade</td><td>7</td><td>28</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>High-grade</td><td>10</td><td>40</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Standard-grade</td><td>14</td><td>56</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>High-grade</td><td>20</td><td>80</td><td>40</td></tr></tbody></table>"
