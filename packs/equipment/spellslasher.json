When it's applied to a weapon, it attunes the weapon to magical energies, allowing it to slice through spells as though they were physical threads. While your weapon is under the effect of a <em>spellslasher</em>, you gain the Spellslash reaction; you can use this reaction only with the affected weapon, and the <em>spellslasher</em>'s effects end as soon as you use Spellslash.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellslash</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">R</span> (magical, manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You are the only target of a spell</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You swing or shoot your weapon to intercept the magic, attempting to counteract the spell.
