The creature's famed regenerative powers are still present, despite the creature's death; if damaged, the <em>hydra head club</em> repairs itself at the rate of 1 Hit Point per minute, unless it has been completed destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Activateâ€”Reactive Snap</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">f</span> (attack)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You attempt a Strike as a Reaction</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The <em>hydra head club</em> snaps with a momentary burst of its former glory.
