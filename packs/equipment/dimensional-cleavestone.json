A visible slash appears in both locations, displaying the view from the other side.</p>\n<p>Until the end of your next turn, these two squares are treated as adjacent to each other; for example, creatures could Stride or be Shoved through the rifts to their other side, and a creature adjacent to one rift can Strike a creature adjacent to the other.</p>\n<p>When Tearing a Rift, you can choose to Step through the rift as part of the activity. The rifts don't automatically pull creatures or objects through, as they take up only a small amount of space within the square, and a creature sharing a space with a rift is unaffected except for determining adjacency. You can have only one rift active at a time.</p>"
