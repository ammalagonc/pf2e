This whetstone is favored by duelists who like to take their foe by surprise. When you use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Quick Draw] feat with a weapon under the effect of a <em>windstep sheath</em>, you can also Step as part of that action, either immediately before or after your Strike.</p>"
