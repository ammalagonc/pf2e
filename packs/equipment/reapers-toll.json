As long as you carry this weapon, your presence repels and noticeably unnerves most animals, causing them to avoid you if possible and react to you with a starting attitude one step worse than normal if made to interact with you directly. The one exception is vermin who scavenge corpses; they appear around you with greater frequency. Small mundane plants, such as grass or flowers, wilt and die after spending 24 hours in close proximity to a reaper's toll, crumbling to dust 24 hours after that.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activateâ€”Reaper's Claim</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span></p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet is reduced to 0 Hit Points</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Make a melee Strike with reaper's toll as though you were in the space of the triggering creature.
