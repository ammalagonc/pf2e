The tattoo can hold text equivalent to two pages of a book, a single scroll, or a similar area of other surfaces, though it doesn't replicate any magical effect or other special properties of the original words. You can Dismiss this effect, and when you Dismiss it, the tattoo copies the original text onto a blank writing surface you're touching.</p>"
