Draw a card from a harrow deck or roll 1d6:</p>\n<p>1 = hammers (Athletics)</p>\n<p>2 = keys (Acrobatics)</p>\n<p>3 = shields (Survival)</p>\n<p>4 = books (any Recall Knowledge)</p>\n<p>5 = stars (Religion)</p>\n<p>6 = crowns (Diplomacy).</p>\n<p>The next time you attempt a check of the same type as your result, roll twice and take the better result, as the spirits of the harrow guide your actions. If not used by your next daily preparations, this benefit disappears.</p>"
