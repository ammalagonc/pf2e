When all of the charms are consumed, the strand becomes inert.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate—Hero-God's Whisper</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (auditory, interact, light)</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You detach a charm, which creates a glowing ghostly image of the hero-god depicted on it. This image sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) for 1 hour. Allies within the image's bright light hear the constant whispers of Ekriathe or her successor's voice, and they gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws against auditory effects. Enemies entering or ending their term in the image's radius of bright light must attempt a @Check[will|dc:23] save. On a failure, the target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Fascinated] and takes a –2 status penalty to auditory-based Perception checks while they remain in the radius. Creatures that succeed against this effect are temporarily immune for the next 24 hours.</p>"
