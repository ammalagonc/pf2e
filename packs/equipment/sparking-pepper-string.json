Their spiciness cuts through the fatty meats that are also popular during late nights, and the sparks from the peppers serve as a pick-me-up to maintain the energy for a party. After you eat a sparking pepper string, your body bristles with electricity until the end of your next turn. When you successfully Strike a target with an unarmed attack or a metal weapon, you can end this effect as a free action to have the attack deal an additional 1d6 electricity damage. If not expended before the duration ends, the electricity dissipates harmlessly.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-effects.Item.Effect: Sparking Pepper String]</p>"
