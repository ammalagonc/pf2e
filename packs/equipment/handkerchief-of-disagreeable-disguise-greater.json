However, the illusion disadvantages you based on your intent, making you, for example, appear to be a suspicious ruffian if you're trying to sneak past guards or lending you the seeming of a pauper if you're trying to impress a shallow aristocrat. You and those you consider to be allies must succeed at a @Check[will|dc:23] save or you perceive the illusion as you intended it, though others won't. Evidence to the contrary allows you to attempt to disbelieve the false version of the illusion. You can't Dismiss the spell.</p>"
