When you apply a <em>blade phantom's guide</em> to a weapon, it summons a spiritual fragment of a warrior who was adept with that weapon. For 1 minute, you treat your proficiency with that weapon as equal to your highest weapon proficiency. This effect cannot affect a weapon whose level is higher than the <em>blade phantom's guide</em> (11th).</p>"
