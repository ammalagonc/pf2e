The spirit fragment is transferred into your weapon for 1 hour, keeping watch for creatures with the chosen trait or traits. The affected weapon vibrates slightly if such a creature is within 60 feet of you, unless the creature is disguised or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Hidden] and has a Deception or Stealth DC of 26 or higher.</p>"
