A @Template[type:emanation|distance:60] centered on the lantern is plunged into darkness for 1 minute. This darkness functions as a 4th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Darkness] spell. When the darkness is created, it deals @Damage[6d8[spirit]|options:area-damage] damage (@Check[fortitude|dc:30|basic|options:area-effect] save) to all creatures within the area. Any creature reduced to 0 Hit Points from this damage is destroyed entirely, leaving behind only a shadow that will slowly fade over the course of a year.</p>"
