On a success, the failed prophet pilfers coins and gems from the target with a total value as indicated in the table, to a maximum of what the target is carrying. Valuables in unlocked containers on the target's person can be taken just as easily as those carried. On a critical success, the failed prophet steals double that amount. The failed prophet gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the value stolen that last for 1 minute.</p><table class=\"pf2e lost-omens\"><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Value Stolen</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>10–12</p></td><td><p>[[/r 5d10]] gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13–15</p></td><td><p>[[/r 6d10]] gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16–18</p></td><td><p>[[/r 7d10]] gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19–20</p></td><td><p>[[/r 8d10]] gp</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"
